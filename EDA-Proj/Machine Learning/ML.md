# Machine Learning
Tagging objects and photos are clearly a machine learning play.

ML is important to predict hidden insights of data.

### Types of Machine Learning
1. Supervised Learning
   - Work under supervision
   - teacher 
   - Prediction
   - Outcome 

```
INPUT DATA(80%)| TRAINING MODEL & LEARNING PATTERN OF DATA (20%)| PREDICTION | OUTPUT & REPORTS 
```
#### Types 
- Classification 
  - For categorical
- Regression
  - For numerical Data
  - 
#### Algorithm:
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
- Support Vector Machine(SVM)
- Kernal SVM
- Naive Bayes
- Decision Tree Classification
- Random Forest Classification
  
2. Un-Supervised Learning
   - No Supervision
   - No Teacher
   - Self learning
   - No labelling of data 
   - Find pattern by itself  
```
TRAINING MODEL & LEARNING PATTERN OF DATA| PREDICTION | OUTPUT & REPORT
```
### Algorithms:
- K-Means clustring
- Hierarchical Clustring
- Probabilistic clustring
  
3. Semi-Supervised Learning
   - Mixed of 1 & 2
   - Some data is labelled, most is not.
```
INPUT DATA | TRAINING MODEL & LEARNING PATTERN OF DATA(CLUSTRING) | PREDICTION | OUTPUT & REPORTS
```
some labbeled data and some unlabelled data.
4. Reinforcement
   - Hit and trail learning
   - learn from mistakes
   - Reward and punishment rule
   - Prediction based on reward and punishment
   - depends on feed back 

INPUT DATA | TRAINING MODEL & LEARNING PATTERN OF DATA | PREDICTION(by itself/hit & trail) | OUTPUT & REPORTS

### Algorithms:
- Model_Free Reinforcement Learning
  - Policy optimization
  - Q-Learning
- Model-Based Reinforcement Learning
  - Learn the model
  - Give the model
