# Rules
# must start with underscore or alphabet, number may come after character, 
# Camal style or snake style conventions for writing variable names
# No need to specify data type in python.  

# number = 2
# print(number),
# number = "Obaid"
# print(number)
# -----String concatination------------
first_name = 'Obaid'
last_name = 'Ullah'
full_name = first_name + last_name
# print(full_name)
# print(full_name * 3)
# print(full_name + 3)  typing error to remove this error we could write 3 in quotes or with string function
# print(full_name + str(3)) # output: ObaidUllah3
# print(full_name + '3')  # output: ObaidUllah3
