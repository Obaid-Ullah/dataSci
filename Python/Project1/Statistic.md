- Regression Analysis
  *****
  ### Scientific computing:
  ****
#### Pandas:
Data structures & tools for 2D data frames
#### Numpy:
Array & matrices.
#### Scipy:
optimizing and soving different equations.
#### Data Viz:
- Matplot
- Seaborn
#### Machine Learning(ML) Algorithems:
  - Scikit learn
    - ML:regression, classification,clustring,analysis and so on.
  - Statsmodels
      - Explore data,Estimation of statistical models, and platform statistical analysis.
## Statistics:
Collection of methods for collecting, displaying, analyzing and drawing conclusions from data.
> Also Called Data Analysis

### Statistics if Everything
- Prediction
- Rate of USD prediction
- Un-employeement rate fallen
- ANOVA etc
- Any comparison in research

### Learning of Statistics
- Max
- min
- avg,
- percentage
- varience
- T-Test
- ANOVA
- Likelihood

## Types of data:

### Data type 1:
Cross Sectional | Time Series | 
---------|----------|
 Data collection at one point |Data collection at different time period |

### Data type 2:
Uni-Variable | Multi-Variable | 
---------|----------|
  |Single Variable to measure entity i.e. Plant height |Contain 2 variables to measuresomething i.e.Furtilizer, water time, plant height |

## Variable Type:
#### Variable Type 1:

catagorical(nominal) |  | 
---------|----------|
 Binomial(yes/No) | Multi-nomial(travel choice) | 
 No quantitative relationship is given 

### Variable Type 2:
- Categorical(Nominal)
- Ordinal Variable
- Ranking and ordered

### Variable Type 3:
- Ratio Data
  - data have a natural zero 1.0,2.0,3.0 etc

### variable Type 4:
- Interval
-   Variables/Data
-   ordered and characterized data 
-   relations are meaningless.

## Measures of Central Tendency:
-  Mean
-  Median
-  Mode

##### Population Vs Sample
- Population have more power and are more accurate.
- Samples use to reduce the cost of data collection.
  
  N= size of population
  n= size of sample
  sigma = Sum

> Search some other statistical terms and note down.

## Measurement:
A number or attribute computed for each number of a population of a sample . The measuremnet of sample elements are collectively called the sample data.
### Parameter 
A number that summarizes some aspects of the population as a whole.
### Statistic:
A number computed from the sample data.
### Descriptive Statistics:
The branch of statistics that involves organizing , displaying & describing data.
### Inferantial statistic:
The branch of statistics that involve draawing conculsions about a population based on the information contained in a sample taken from that population.
## Quantitative Data:
- Numerical
## Qualitative Data:
- Catagorical
## Mean
- Average { sum of all divided by total no. of elements}
### Properties
- meaningful -> for ratio & interval data
- outliers change the mean of data, there for median is useful.
## Median
- The middle number in a sorted, asc/desc, list of numbers.
- Outliers don't have any effect on median.
- Ratio,interval and ordinal data has best use.
- Unique for each daatset.

## Mode.
The value that occure most frequently
## Dispersion:

how much data spread around mean.
- Standard deviation (SD)
- standard error (SE)
- varience
- Bell curve 
Cause by differene b/w max & min value.
simply range between min to max.
## SD & Mean
### Reliability
- Mean only give us a small picture.
  - Incomple without dispersion(SD).
  > **Rule of Thumb:**\
  > Mean with a SD is more useful then only mean by itself.

#### Fundamental of Visualization: 
Two types of variable are used on plots.\
depend on demand.
- Catagorical Variables:\
  **Qualitative Variable**
  - True/False
  - Yes/no
  - Male/female
- Continuous variables:\
  **Quantitative Variables**
  - Scattered plot
  - statistical properties (means & their comparisons)
